 Lisp Games Community Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let it be observed that the Lisp game development community is not
limited to any one nation, creed, color, or gender; also that we are
not bound to any single website, platform, codebase, or dialect.

In addressing conduct which the community frowns upon, we first and
foremost defer to the rules already governing the forum where the
conduct occurs---Freenode in the case of IRC, Reddit in the case of
/r/lisp, and so on. Users already agree to such rules when they log
onto Freenode, create a Reddit account, and so on.

We pledge to follow these guidelines:

1. Please do not issue threats or use hostile language or personal
   insults in communication with your fellow community members.
   
2. Please work together to solve conflicts in good faith. 

3. Please do not use discriminatory epithets against your fellow
   community members, whether directed at those present or at others
   who are absent.

4. Please do not bully, harass, defame, or ostracize your fellow
   community members, participate in "social media shaming", or
   contact (or assist or encourage others to contact) a particular
   person and/or their employers, coworkers, clients, family, friends,
   university, other projects or communities, or any other third party
   with nasty messages, allegations, or other negative information
   about that person, whether such contact is publicly or privately
   orchestrated.

5. Allegations of wrongdoing or criminal behavior must be referred to
   law enforcement. If you believe yourself or another person to be in
   danger, or if you have reason to believe that a crime has been or
   will be committed, call the police. Community members shall not
   attempt to litigate or investigate allegations of wrongdoing or
   criminal behavior in any other way than by immediately referring
   such claims to law enforcement authorities.
